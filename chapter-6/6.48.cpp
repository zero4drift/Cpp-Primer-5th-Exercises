// sring s;
// while(cin >> s && s != sought) { }
// assert(cin); not reasonable; cin object converted to bool which maybe true, for that in while loop the second condition is false but the first is true. If some one wants to get notified and the program automatically stopped when at last comes to that assert statement, that may be not come true.
