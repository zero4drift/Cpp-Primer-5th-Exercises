# Cpp-Primer-5th-Exercises

Solutions to C++ Primer 5th exercises.

I bought this great book in early 2015, at that time I was green:), after a painful learning attempt, I gave up.

Now then with experience gained during almost 3 years' programming work, It's a good time to make a second attempt.

By the way, I really appreciate the way the exercises arranged in this book, fewer but better. Some books I read before have hundreds of exercises attached to the end of a chapter, that fades readers' motivations.
