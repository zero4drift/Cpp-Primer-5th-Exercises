// We should define the conversion operators illustrated in exercise 14.45 for Sales_data class type;
// and the first conversion operators should be explicit, for when there is a expression includes operands of Sales_data object and string object, due to that Sales_data class type has a constructor accepts one const string reference, causes amgibuous situation then this expression is illegal;
// the second one does not need to be explicit, there's no such concern for it as the first one.
