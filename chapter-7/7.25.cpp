// Class screen could safely rely on the default copy and assignment operations which generated by compiler, for that class screen is constructed on the base of vector object and string object(both types support robust copy, assignment and destroy operations, when there is a need to do so to screen object, vector object and string object would have corresponding operations underneath) and built-in types.
