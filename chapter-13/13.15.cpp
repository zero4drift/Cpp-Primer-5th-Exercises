// if a copy constructor is defined within class type numbered,
// outputs would be changed, for that copy constructor would generage a new number for the object,
// what's more, function accepts a 'numbered s' type parameter, this would call copy instructor when called, and 's.mysn' is different from the argument passed in,
// different outputs, and not expected, do not match the real mysn member of original objects.
